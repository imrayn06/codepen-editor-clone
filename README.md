# codepen-editor-clone

In the project directory, you can run:
npm start

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


npm test

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
For more information on running tests, see the documentation.


npm run build

Builds the app for production into the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!


npm run eject

Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot go back!

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

It will copy all the configuration files and dependencies (like Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project so you have full control over them. Once ejected, all of the commands (except eject) will still work, but they will now point to the copied scripts and configurations.

At this point, you're on your own for customizing the configuration.

You do not need to eject unless you have a very specific requirement that the current setup cannot satisfy.
